This project was created to explain a problem on the jersey forum.

The issue is that namespaces do not seem to work correctly for me.

I'm running 

java version "1.6.0_26"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03-383-11A511)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.1-b02-383, mixed mode)

on a mac version 10.7.1

I'm also using maven
